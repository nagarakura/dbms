Flights (no: integer, src: string, dst: string, distance:
integer, Departs: time, arrives: time, price: real)
 Aircraft (aid: integer, aname: string, cruisingrange:
integer)
 Certified (eid: integer, aid: integer)
 Employees (eid: integer, ename: string, salary: integer)
Note that the Employees relation describes pilots and other
kinds of employees as well. Every pilot is certified for some
aircraft, and only pilots are certified to fly.

Queries:
1. Find the names of aircraft such that all

salaries more than Rs.80, 000.
Method 1.
SELECT DISTINCT A.aname
FROM AIRCRAFT A, CERTIFIED C
WHERE A.aid=C.aid AND
C.eid IN ( SELECT eid
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE salary > 80000);
Method 2.
SELECT DISTINCT a.aname
FROM aircraft a
WHERE a.aid NOT IN
( SELECT c.aid
FROM certified c,employees e
WHERE c.eid=e.eid AND
e.salary<80000);
2. For each pilot who is certified for more
than three aircrafts, find the eid and the
maximum cruisingrange of the aircraft for
which she or he is certified.
SELECT C.eid, MAX(a.cruisingrange)
FROM CERTIFIED C, AIRCRAFT A
WHERE C.aid=A.aid
GROUP BY C.eid
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
3. Find the names of pilots whose salary is
less than the price of the cheapest route
from Bengaluru to Frankfurt.
SELECT E.ename
FROM EMPLOYEES E
WHERE E.salary < (SELECT min(price)
FROM FLIGHTS
WHERE fromPlace=‘bangalore’ AND
oPlace='frankfurt');
4. For all aircraft with cruising range over
1000 Kms, .find the name of the aircraft
and the average salary of all pilots certified
for this aircraft.
select aname, avg(salary) as avgsal

e
where a.crusingrange>1000 and
c.aid=a.aid and
c.eid=e.eid
group by aname;
5. Find the names of pilots certified for
some Boeing aircraft.
SELECT DISTINCT E.ename
FROM AIRCRAFT A, CERTIFIED C, EMPLOYEES
E

C.eid=E.eid AND
A.aname LIKE 'boeing%';
6. Find the aids of all aircraft that can be
used on routes from Bengaluru to New
Delhi
SELECT A.aid
