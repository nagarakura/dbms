To identify the student(s) who are charged an average fee less than INR 1800 and have registered for more than one course, you can use the following query:
SQL
SELECT studentid, AVG(fee) AS AVGFEE
FROM registration
GROUP BY studentid
HAVING AVG(fee) < 1800
AND COUNT(*) > 1;


To create a view to identify the course details that contain more than 12 letters in the course name with duration more than 3 days, you can use the following query:
SQL
CREATE VIEW long_course_names AS
SELECT coursename, noofdays
FROM course
WHERE LENGTH(coursename) > 12
AND noofdays > 3;



To create a new entity that contains the totalfee collected wrt each course and demonstrate trigger such that on registration of new student the totalfee should be computed, you can use the following queries:

CREATE TABLE totalfee (
    courseid INT NOT NULL,
    totalfee INT NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT totalfee_pk PRIMARY KEY (courseid)
);

CREATE TRIGGER totalfee_trigger
AFTER INSERT ON registration
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DECLARE totalfee INT;

    SELECT SUM(fee) INTO totalfee
    FROM registration
    WHERE courseid = NEW.courseid;

    UPDATE totalfee
    SET totalfee = totalfee
    WHERE courseid = NEW.courseid;
END;



To demonstrate the working of the procedure to identify the student(s) having letter T anywhere in their name and who are residing in Bangalore or Mangalore, you can use the following procedure:
SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE students_with_t_in_name_bangalore_or_mangalore ()
BEGIN
    SELECT studentid, studentname, city
    FROM student
    WHERE studentname LIKE '%T%'
    AND city IN ('Bangalore', 'Mangalore');
END;



To demonstrate delete/update cascade with simple query, you can use the following queries:
SQL
-- Delete a student
DELETE FROM student WHERE studentid = 1;

-- Check that the registrations for the deleted student are also deleted
SELECT * FROM registration WHERE studentid = 1;

-- Update the city of a student
UPDATE student
SET city = 'Mumbai'
WHERE studentid = 1;

-- Check that the registrations for the student are also updated
SELECT * FROM registration WHERE studentid = 1;
