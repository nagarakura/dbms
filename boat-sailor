1. Find the colors of boats reserved by Albert.
SELECT color 
FROM s, b, r 
WHERE r.sid=s.sid AND r.bid=b.bid AND 
 sname=`Albert’ 

 
2. Find all sailor id’s of sailors who have a rating of at least 8 or reserved boat 103.
(SELECT sid 
FROM s 
WHERE rating>=8) 
UNION 
(SELECT sid 
FROM r 
WHERE bid=103) 

3. Find the names of sailors who have not reserved a boat whose name contains the string 
“storm”. Order the names in ascending order. 
SELECT sname 
FROM s s1 
WHERE sid NOT IN 
 (SELECT sid 
 FROM r, s 
 WHERE r.sid=s.sid AND sname LIKE `%storm%’) 
ORDER BY s1.sname 

4. Find the sailor id’s of sailors with age over 20 who have not reserved a boat whose name 
includes the string “thunder”.
SELECT sid 
FROM s 
WHERE age>20 AND sid NOT IN 
 (SELECT sid 
 FROM r, b 
 WHERE r.bid=b.bid AND bname LIKE `%thunder%’) 
 
5. Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least two boats.
 
SELECT sname 
FROM s, r r1, r r2 
WHERE s.sid=r1.sid AND s.sid=r2.sid AND 
 r1.bid<>r2.bid 
Note: If we want to eliminate duplicates, we SELECT DISTINCT sname. Alternatively, we 
could simply change the condition in the WHERE clause from r1.bid<>r2.bid to, say 
r1.bid<r2.bid. (Why would this have the same effect?) 

6. Find the names of sailors who have reserved all boats.
SELECT sname 
FROM s 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
 SELECT * 
 FROM b 
 WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
 SELECT * 
 FROM r 
 WHERE r.sid=s.sid AND r.bid=b.bid)) 


7. Find the names of sailors who have reserved all boats whose name starts with “typhoon”.
SELECT sname 
FROM s 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
 SELECT * 
 FROM b 
 WHERE bname LIKE `typhoon%’ AND NOT EXISTS ( 
 SELECT * 
 FROM r 
 WHERE r.sid=s.sid AND r.bid=b.bid)) 
 
8. Find the sailor id’s of sailors whose rating is better than some sailor called Bob.
SELECT s1.sid 
FROM s s1, s s2 
WHERE s1.rating>s2.rating AND s2.sname=`Bob’ 
Alternatively: 
SELECT sid 
FROM s 
WHERE rating > any (
 SELECT rating 
 FROM s s2 
 WHERE s2.sname=`Bob’)) 

 
9. Find the sailor id’s of sailors whose rating is better than every sailor called Bob.
SELECT sid 
FROM s 
WHERE rating > all (
 SELECT rating 
 FROM s s2 
 WHERE s2.sname=`Bob’) 
 
10. Find the sailor id’s of sailors with the highest rating.
SELECT sid 
FROM s s1 
WHERE s1.rating >= all ( 
 SELECT rating 
 FROM s) 
 
11. Find the name and age of the oldest sailor.
SELECT s1.sname, s1.age 
FROM s s1 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
 SELECT * 
 FROM s s2 
 WHERE s2.age>s1.age) 
Alternatively: 
SELECT s1.sname, s1.age 
FROM s s1 
WHERE s1.age >= all ( 
 SELECT age 
 FROM s) 
 
12. Find the names of sailors who have reserved every boat reserved by those with a lower 
rating. 
SELECT s1.sname 
FROM s s1 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
 SELECT * 
 FROM b, r, s s2 
 WHERE s2.sid=r.sid AND s2.bid=b.bid AND s2.rating<s1.rating AND 
 NOT EXISTS ( 
 SELECT * 
 FROM r r2 
 WHERE s1.sid=r2.sid AND r2.bid=b.bid)) 
Alternatively: 
SELECT s1.sname 
FROM s s1 
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( 
 (SELECT b1.bid 
 FROM b b1, r, s s2 
 WHERE s2.rating<s1.rating AND s2.sid=r.sid) 
 EXCEPT 
 (SELECT b2.bid 
 FROM b b2, r r2 
 WHERE r2.bid=b.bid AND r2.sid=s1.sid)) 


13. For each rating, find the average age of sailors at that level of rating. 
SELECT rating, AVG(age) 
FROM s 
GROUP BY rating 

14. For each boat which was reserved by at least 5 distinct sailors, find the boat id and the 
average age of sailors who reserved it. 
SELECT b.bid, AVG(age) 
FROM b, r, s 
WHERE b.bid=r.bid AND r.sid=s.sid 
GROUP BY bid 
HAVING 5<=COUNT(DISTINCT r.sid) 
This is equivalent to the following more complex query, which many optimizers may not 
optimize well and hence the DBMS may take longer to evaluate the following query. 
SELECT b1.bid, AVG(s.age) 
FROM r, s (SELECT bid 
 FROM b, r r2 
 WHERE b.bid=r2.bid 
 GROUP BY bid 
 HAVING 5<=COUNT(DISTINCT r2.sid)) b1 
WHERE b1.bid=r.bid AND r.sid=s.sid 
GROUP BY b1.bid 

15. For each boat which was reserved by at least 5 sailors with age >= 40, find the boat id and 
the average age of such sailors. 
SELECT bid, AVG(age) 
FROM b, r, s 
WHERE s.age>=40 AND b.bid=r.bid AND s.sid=r.sid 
GROUP BY bid 
HAVING 5<=COUNT(DISTINCT s.sid) 

16. For each boat which was reserved by at least 5 sailors with age >= 40, find the boat id and 
the average age of all sailors who reserved the boat. 
SELECT b1.bid, AVG(s.age) 
FROM r, s (SELECT bid 
 FROM b, r r2, s s2 
 WHERE b.bid=r2.bid AND s2.sid=r.sid AND s.age>=40 
 GROUP BY bid 
 HAVING 5<=COUNT(DISTINCT r2.sid)) b1 
WHERE b1.bid=r.bid AND r.sid=s.sid 
GROUP BY b1.bid
